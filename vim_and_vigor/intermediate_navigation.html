<h1>Intermediate Vim Navigation</h1>

<p>Now that we know some basic Vim navigation, it's time to learn some more 
advanced commands.</p>
<h3>Moving by Sentence and Paragraph</h3>
<p>To move forward one sentence, type ), and to move backward one sentence, 
type (. To move forward one paragraph, type }, and to move backward one 
paragraph, type {.</p>
<h3>Moving on the Screen</h3>
<p>To move to the top, middle, or bottom of the screen, type H, M, or L, 
respectively. All of these are case-sensitive, so make sure it's 
uppercase.</p>
<h3>Moving to Specified Characters on a Line</h3>
<p>For all of the following commands, you must type a character 
immediately after the command. To move to the next specified character in 
the same line, type f. For example, to move to the next "m" in the same 
line, type fm. Likewise, to move to the previous specified character in 
the same line, type F. Obviously, these commands are both case-sensitive. 
The commands t and T work just like f and F, except that they move you to 
just before the next or previous specified character in the same line.<p>
<h3>More Movement</h3>
<p>To move one page up or one page down, press the <PGUP> or <PGDN> key, 
respectively. Typing two single quotes, as in '', will move you to the 
line where the cursor was before the most recent move. This will not 
work if you type one set of double quotes. Typing two back ticks, as in 
``, will move you to the position where the cursor was before the most 
recent move. The back tick key is located over the tab key on most 
keyboards. Typing % will move you to a corresponding item. For instance, 
if you are at an open bracket and would like to move to its corresponding 
closed bracket, typing % will bring you there.</p>
<h3>Changing and Deleting Words</h3>
<p>The cw command will change a word by deleting the text and then 
entering insert mode. The cb command works similarly, except that it 
changes the word backwards. For either of these, typing a number 
after the c will change that many words. For example, the command to 
change two words would be c2w. To delete a word, type dw. This is 
essentially the same as the cw command; the only difference is that 
cw will switch you to insert mode after deleting the text, while dw 
will keep you in normal mode after the command has been executed.</p>
<h3>Changing and Deleting Text until A Specified Character</p>
<p>Similar to when moving to specific characters in the same line, the 
following commands require you to type a character immediately after 
the command. Typing ct will change (delete) all text in the line until 
the next specified character in that line. For example, typing ctp will 
delete all the text in that line until the next p. Typing cf executes a 
similar action, except that the deleted text inclues the specified 
character. Additionally, like the cw and cb commands, the ct and cf 
commands will switch you to insert mode until you choose to return to 
normal mode. If you wish to delete text and stay in normal mode, dt 
and df will act similarly to ct and cf, respectively.</p>
<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
<p>To undo, type u, and to redo, type CTRL plus r. Undo and redo will 
both work multiple times rather than just once.</p>
