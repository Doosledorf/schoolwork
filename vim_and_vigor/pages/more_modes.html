	<h1>Switching Between Modes</h1>
	<p>To get out of whatever mode you are in (especially in case you don't know 
	or can't remember what mode you're in), just press the <Esc> key twice, which 
	will return you to normal mode. The only mode in which you cannot do this is ex 
	mode, where instead you must type ":visual" in order to return to normal mode. 
	Once you have returned to normal mode, you will see the screen flash or head a 
	bell to let you know you have succeeded.</p>
