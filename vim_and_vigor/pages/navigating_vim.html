			execute for x number of words. For example, typing 3e will move you 
			to the end of the word that is three words over.</td>

			<td>G</td>
			<td>Move to the last line</td>
			<td>Typing a number before the command "G" will move you to the line 
			that corresponds with that number. For example, typing 45G will move 
			you to line 45.</td>

			<td>For example, this would move you from an open bracket to its 
			matching close bracket.</td>

			<td>Change word by deleting text and then entering insert mode</td>
			<td>Type a number between the "c" and the "w", or between the "c" 
			and the "b" (when changing a word backwards) will change that many 
			words. For example, typing c2d will change two words.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>cb</td>
			<td>Change word backwards, similar to cw</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>dw</td>
			<td>Delete word and stay in normal mode</td>
			<td>The difference between cw and dw is that cw will delete the 
			word(s) and then switch you to insert mode, while dw will delete 
			the words(s) and keep you in normal mode.</td>

			the most recent save.</td>

			<td>f</td>
			<td>Move to the next specified character in the same line</td>
			<td>You must type a character after "f" (or after a F, t, T, ct, cf, 
			dt, or df command). For example, typing fg will move you to the next 
			g on the same line.</td>
