<h1>Installing and Opening Vim</h1>
<h2>File Formats</h2>
<p>Vim recognizes three file formats (Unix, DOS, and Mac) that determine line ending characters.</p>
<h2>Installation<a name="install"></a></h2>
<p>Visit <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">Vim's Download Page</a> and select the correct download link for your operating system. Vim comes pre-installed on Mac OSX as well as most Linux Distributions, so if you're using Mac or Linux, simply open a Terminal, type in "vim", hit enter and it should open for you! If it doesn't you can follow the steps on the Vim Download page to install it. Below is how to install Vim in Windows.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu Linux</h3>

<div class="commandBox">sudo apt-get install vim</div>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>If you stick with the default installation options on Windows, three Vim 
icons will appear on your computer desktop: gVim 7.4, gVim Easy 7.4, and 
gVim Read only 7.4. The only difference between standard and easy is that gVim 
Easy begins and locks in insert mode, whereas standard starts in normal mode 
and you can choose to toggle between modes. <a href="pages/modes.html">Learn more 
about modes.</a></p>
<h3>Mac, Linux and Unix</h3>
<p>In Mac, Linux and Unix based operating systems, open a terminal and type "vim" followed by a space and name of the file you want to edit or create. It's that easy! An example can be seen below.</p>
<div class="commandBox">vim foo.txt</div>
