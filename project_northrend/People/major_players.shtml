						<h1>Alexstrasza</h1>
						<p>		Alexstrasza the Life Binder, Red Dragon Aspect, Head of the Wyrmrest Accord, Guardian of all Life in Azeroth and Queen of Dragons was appointed as such by the 
								Titans themselves. She and her followers avoid killing if possible, but will not shy away from bringing justice upon those who deserve it. Her abilities lean towards
								healing and resurrection, though when on the offensive, she can morph into a very imposing red dragon.</p>
	
						<p>		She fights two battles currently. One against the Lich King and his Scourge; the other against Malygos and his Blue Dragonflight. Members of the Black Dragonflight 
								tend to pose a nuisance often.</p>

						<h1>Malygos</h1>
						<p>		Malygos the Blue Dragon Aspect, SpellWeaver, Hidden Arcanum and Guardian of Magic, leads a genocidal crusade against magic users and seeks to rein in the "unbridled"
								magic use throughout Azeroth through his Nexus in the Borean Tundra. He was not always this way. Only after his bout with Deathwing eons prior, did he become 
								unhinged. His sanity was eventually regained, but in his newfound lucidity and fear of "rogue" magic use reining in powers like Deathwing and Sargeras did 
								Malygos seek to take it away from the world.</p>
						<p> 	Malygos intends on using the Arcanomicon to find the world's magical leylines and divert them to his Nexus. Players
								eventually end his mad quest.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/People/darion.jpg" alt ="Darion Morgraine"/>
					
					
						<h1>Darion Morgraine</h1>
						<p>		Darion was once Highlord of the Death Knights of Archeus and was charged by the Lich King himself to purge
								the land of the living. Only when the Lich King sent Darion and his men to their deaths in attempts to bring Tirion Fordring out of hiding did Darion turn against the 
								Lich King. The King repeled him easily, but right as Darion was to be put to death, he threw the Corrupted Ashbringer to Tirion, whom used its now
								purified form to fight back the Lich King. Darion now leads the Knights of the Ebon Blade against the Lich King in an attempt to wipe away his forces from 
								Ebon Hold, making it a home for all Death Knights.</p>
						<p>		He and Tirion lead the Ashen Verdict against the Lich King during the Battle at Icecrown Citadel.</p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/People/tirion.jpg" alt ="Tirion Fordring"/>
					
					
						<h1>Tirion Fordring</h1>
						<p>		Tirion was one of the original Knights of the Silver Hand. He unites the Knights and the Argent Dawn to form the Argent Crusade
								after reclaiming Ashbringer from Darion. He co-leads the Ashen Verdict with Darion during the Battle of Icecrown Citadel and 
								eventually makes it to the Frozen Throne alongside the player. In the ensuing battle with the Lich King, he shatters the King's Shadowmourne, releasing
								all the souls trapped within and giving the players an opportunity to win.</p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/People/jaina.jpg" alt ="Jaina Proudmoore"/>
					
					
						<h1>Jaina Proudmoore</h1>
						<p>		Founder of Theramore and member of the Kirin Tor, Jaina seeks to release Arthas, her lost love, from his Lich King status. After events in the Halls of
								Reflection, Jaina finds that her wishes mean nothing and the Lich King must be killed and replaced. </p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/People/sylvanas.jpg" alt ="Sylvanas"/>
					
					
						<h1>Sylvanas</h1>
						<p>		Sylvanas is the leader of the Forsaken and Banshee Queen. The Lich King, as Arthas, destroyed her home, Quel'Thalas and killed her himself.
								She was then raised as an undead minion. Eventually she regained her free will and plotted her revenge against the Lich King and his Scourge.</p>
						<p> 	She does eventually battle the Lich King, but he proves far more powerful than she realized and was forced to amass and combine forces with her enemies, so that
								he may be bought to justice. </p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/People/arthas.jpg" alt ="Arthas"/>
					
					
						<h1>Arthas</h1>
						<p>		AKA the Lich King. This current incarnation of the Lich King is a result of a merger between Arthas and Ner'zhul, the original
								Lich King bound to the Frozen Throne.</p>
						<p>		Arthas was not always the Lich King. In fact, he was the opposite. He was a Knight of the Silver Hand and a Prince of Lordaeron, tutored by the great Uther the Lightbringer himself.
								After his futile attempts to save souls at Stratholme, Arthas disbanded the Knights. The Culling of Stratholme would haunt him for all his days. Finding
								Shadowmourne in Northrend and at that moment, his corruption was guaranteed. He killed his father, destroyed Lordaeron, Quel'Thas and Dalaran and eventually
								fled to Northrend to find the Frozen Throne. After fighting Illidan for it, Arthas sat on the throne and donned the Lich King's helmet, merging his mind
								with Ner'zhul's. He became the Lich King.</p>
						<p> 	As the Lich King, he used his Scourge invasion to lure heroes to him, so that he may further corrupt them and use them as commanders. The Battle at Icecrown almost insured that, but Tirion 
								shattered Shadowmourne and its bounded souls were released. Players were then revived to finally put an end to his madness.</p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/People/bolvar.jpg" alt ="Bolvar Fordragon"/>
					
					
						<h1>Bolvar Fordragon</h1>
						<p>		Bolvar Fordragon was a revered paladin and Commander of the Alliance Vanguard who was thought to have died initially at the Wrathgate--be that by plague or by fire.
								He wasn't. In fact he was taken in by the Scourge, is body badly burned and taken to the Lich King for torture. The Lich King could not break
								his will and Bolvar lasted until the Lich King's demise. It was at that point, that Bolvar Fordragon stopped Tirion from donning the helm of the Lich King 
								(there must always be one) and took it upon himself to do so. Bolvar Fordragon became the Jailer of the Damned and the new Lich King.</p>
