					<h1>Welcome to Northrend</h1>
					<p>		Greetings. I present to you Northrend moreso known as the "Crown of Azeroth." </p>
                    <p>		I hold this continent dear to my hear, especially as it exists during the Wrath of the Lich King--mainly because of the expansion's namesake, The Lich King. I'm a sucker for the tragic-hero archetype and Athas embodies just that. </p>
                    <p>But Northrend simply house one a single treasure. The continent just oozes 'flavor'. Every zone immerses you in their odd little quirks, but they all have this air of majesty about them. There is so much deeply rooted history. Whether its from Sargeras' battle in The Storm Peaks or Galakrond's skeleton in Dragonblight, you can't help but feel a part of it. And when you storm Icecrown Citadel...its just a rush.</p>
					<p>		Lets get on with the show.</p>
