					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/tuskarr.jpg" alt ="A Tuskarr"/>
					
					
						<h1>Tuskarr</h1>
						<p>		A walrus-like people that reside along the southern coast of Northrend. Their capital is Kaskala. Their main leader is Tusklord Hrak'kar.</p>
						<p>		Fishing and whaling is their game. It is what defines their moral standing in life. If a tuskarr is a bad fisherman, he must be an awful person and treated 
								with suspicion. If he hauls in big catches, he is to be treated with respect and is sought after by female tuskarr. </p>
						<p>		Family comes first before the larger community in their culture. Tuskarr are required to tend to the needs of the settlement still and criminals are punished 
								as needed.</p> 
						<p>		Much of Tuskarr architecture is wood, just as much of their clothing is fur. They also farm penguins. Penguins.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/taunka.jpg" alt ="A Taunka"/>
					
					
						<h1>Taunka</h1>
						<p>		Thought-forgotten relatives of the Tauren, the Taunka are a hardy people. They resemble humanoid bison and once resided en masse at Icemist Village in Dragonblight.
								It has since been attacked by nerubians and evacuees have fled to Camp Oneqwah.  </p>
						<p>		Like their Tauren cousins, the Taunka worship the land they walk and are very shamanistic.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/wolvar.jpg" alt ="A Wolvar"/>
					
					
						<h1>Wolvar</h1>
						<p>		These wolverine-like humanoids can be seen across of Northrend. Though tribal and primitive, they are not always savage.</p>
						<p>		The five main tribes are Bloodpaw, Frenzyheart, Howling, Rageclaw and Snowfall. The Frenzyheart in particular are a faction in of itself warring the Oracles in
								Sholazar Basin</p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/nerubian.jpg" alt ="A Nerubian"/>
					
					
						<h1>Nerubian</h1>
						<p>		An ancient race native to Northrend. Their capital is Azjol-Nerub. Their leader formerly Anub'arak</p>
						<p>		They are highly intelligent insectoid creatures whose genetics determine social status--much like ants or bees. Queens are at the top caste, being key to the 
								population as much as they are to keeping order. Workers are the bottom though they can rise up to be seers or webspinners dependant on their revealed
								abilities.</p>
						<p>		There was once a concept of religion in nerubian culture, but is now thought of as alien. Speaking of alien, nerubians are extremely hostile
								to all things that aren't a nerubian, especially members of the Scourge.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/furbolg.jpg" alt ="A Polar Furbolg"/>
					
					
						<h1>Polar Furbolg</h1>
						<p>		Northrend cousins of the Furbolg--much like the Taunka are to the Tauren.  </p>
						<p> 	Their tribes include the Snow Flurry, Snospring, Winterpaw, Redfang and Frostpaw--the last two of which are at war with one another and corrupted by Yogg-Saron</p>
						<p>		Grizzlemaw remains to be the universal capital of all tribes and Baergar Blackpaw is its leader.</p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/oracles.jpg" alt ="A Gorloc"/>
					
					
						<h1>Gorloc</h1>
						<p>		Northrend cousins of the Murloc inherit much of their traits from their relatives: being primitive and hostile. However, The Oracles, a group of Gorlocs 
								exposed to Titan technology are much more intelligent and see themselves as guardians of the pylons in Sholazar Basin. There lies the reason for 
								battling the Wolvar inhabiting the Basin. Their leader, High-Oracle Soo-say makes sure that The Oracles also remain vigilant of the encroaching Scourge as well.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/sons_of_hodir.jpg" alt ="An Ice Giant"/>
					
					
						<h1>Giants</h1>
						<p>		There are many subspecies of giants in Northrend--all of which reside in The Storm Peaks:</p>
						<p> 	The storm giants are capable of summoning small storms and are led of Gymer. They usually isolate themselves from the rest of the world, 
								but they are currently mining Crystalsong.</p>
						<p>		There are the Ice Giants, most of whom serve among the Sons of Hodir. The group is led by Thorim to bring justice to his evil brother, Loken.</p>
						<p>		Opposing the Ice Giants and led by Loken are the Iron Giants and Fire Giants.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "Assets/images/People/native_races/vrykul.jpg" alt ="A Vrykul"/>
					
					
						<h1>Vrykul</h1>
						<p>		Half giant, half-human, the Vrykul are native to the Howling Fjord and led by King Ymiron. They are the direct creation of the Titans.</p>
						<p>		King Ymiron ordered a certain generation of Vrykul to be killed after being deemed "ugly." Not all were killed and instead
								migrated througout the rest of Azeroth, perhaps evolving to become humans. Knowing this, they have begun their 
								offense on the Alliance humans inhabiting the Howling Fjord. Moreso, they serve the Lich King directly.</p>
