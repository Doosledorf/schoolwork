						<h1>Borean Tundra</h1>
						<p>		The Borean Tundra is as its titled: a tundra. Sure there are a couple of trees and farmland, but the
								majority of this expansive land is still frozen, which as one can imagine, creates issues in sustaining food...on land.  
								The shoreline reaches far into the mainland--making it very hard to defend as evidenced by the now invading
								Naga and Vrykul. The Borea River seperates the land from Dragonblight and a mountain range from what Wintergrasp</p>
	
						<p>		The land houses many points of interest. The Horde and Alliance have already made marks on the land through 
								Warsong Hold and Valiance Keep respectively. The native Tuskarr have long since been residing in their capital of Kaskala.
								Finally to the northwest, lies the glacier-isle, Coldarra. There the Blue Dragon Aspect of magic, Malygos resides.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/sholazar_basin.jpg" alt ="Sholozar Basin"/>
						<h1>Sholazar Basin</h1>
						<p>		Sholazar Basin is an oddity, to say the least. Its a tropical jungle...in the north. There are geysers, hot springs and plenty of life.
								However, its climate and general environment is not maintained naturally, but through the pylons erected by the ancient Titans. These pylons 
								rise to the sky like fingers. But climate fixing is not the only purpose these pylons serve. They also act together as a barrier against the dreaded
								Scourge. Unfortunately, the Scourge is taking advantage of a now toppled pylon and are playing offense.
						</p>
						<p>		Currently, the Gorloc tribes are warring against the Wolvar, both native to the area.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/wintergrasp.jpg" alt ="Wintergrasp"/>
						<h1>Wintergrasp</h1>
						<p>		There isn't much to say lore-wise about Wintergrasp. It was once Lake Wintergrasp, but the lake has shrunk a lot since then. It is now
								a battleground for both Horde and Alliance members as it is represented in-game: a PVP hub-zone. Members on either faction are tasked
								with holding Wintergrasp Fortress to reap its rewards.</p>
					</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/icecrown.jpg" alt ="Icecrown"/>
						<h1>Icecrown</h1>
						<p>		Icecrown holds the glacier-turned-fortress, Icecrown Citadel. It has long since been the seat of power for the dreaded Lich King.</p>
						<p>		The Frozen Throne, which sits atop the citadel, was created when Kil'Jaeden had thrown Ner'Zhul's prison into what was once a glacier. 
								Ner'Zhul's mind remained trapped there until freed by Arthas. The two merged to create the current incarnation of the Lich King
								and Arthas has since erected his grand citadel, complete with numerous fortifications and battlements.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/dragonblight.jpg" alt ="Dragonblight"/>
						<h1>Dragonblight</h1>
						<p>		Home to the Taunka, Dragonblight is where dragons come to die. As such, the ground is littered with dragon bones and the Lich King sees this as a perfect
								opportunity to raise his skeletal frost wyrms.  </p>
	
						<p>		Wyrmcrest Temple stands in the middle of the area. It was build by the Titans and is thought to be granted to the Dragonflight, so that the 
								dragons can maintain vigilance over the world. As such, Alexstraze, the Red Dragon-Aspect, stands a top the tower in opposition to the Scourge and 
								the Lich King himself.  </p>
	
						<p>		Kel'Thuzad's floating fortress, Naxxramas, also hovers above Dragonblight and Angrathar the Wrathgate remains to be point of entry into Icecrown for
								both the Horde and Alliance.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/storm_peaks.jpg" alt ="Storm Peaks"/>
						<h1>The Storm Peaks</h1>
						<p>		Residence of the Storm Giants and the Titans before them, The Storm Peaks served as the battleground for Aegwynn and Sargeras, Lord of the
								Burning Legion.</p>
	
						<p>		The peaks are borderline-suicidal to traverse--largely in part to the wind. Due to the formation and sheer height of the peaks, the wind has the
								capability of lifting a person off the ground as if they were paper. Snow is everywhere, so if it <em>were</em> a sunny day, one could easily be blinded. 
								Otherwise that person would have to be satisfied with storms complete with all the fixings: snow, sleet, rain, hail...you name it.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/zul_drak.jpg" alt ="Zul'Drak"/>
						<h1>Zul'Drak</h1>
						<p>		Land of the Drakkari Ice Trolls, Zul'Drak is populated with trees, obelisks and ziggurats. Lots of ziggurats. For a primarily 
								carnivorous race, Zul'Drak certainly houses a lot of trolls. Then again, Drakkari tribes are always at war with each other, so population
								control is very much present.</p>
						<p>		Currently Zul'Drak and moreso the Drakkari, are facing a crisis. In their efforts to fight the scourge, the Drakkari have sacrificed their loa animal 
								gods. This has driven most if not all the Drakkari insane and in the midst of their clash with the Scourge, many groups seek to salvage their history
								before their inevitable fall.</p>
						<p> 	Gun'Drak is Zul'Drak's capital city and home to the Drakkari Frost King.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/crystalsong.jpg" alt ="Crystalsong"/>
						<h1>Crystalsong</h1>
						<p>		This absolutely gorgeous part of Northrend was once the battleground of black and blue dragonflight members. The crystal tree formations are a result of 
								the enormous amount of magic being released at the time. Storm Giants, interested in the power the crystal trees held and green dragonflight members, who guard
								the Great Tree, now protect the forest. In times of desperation, the forest can protect itself as it did when the Lich King attempted to sieze the forest's power.
								The power emitted at the time shook Northrend and vaporized the Lich King's army. The true nature of the forest's power remains unknown, but the Lich King did
								not try again.
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/grizzly_hills.jpg" alt ="Grizzly Hills"/>
						<h1>Grizzly Hills</h1>
						<p>		The first thing one notices when entering the Grizzly Hills is a large hollowed-out tree trunk. That is Grizzlemaw. It is home to the Furbolg of Northrend as is the
								rest of the Grizzly Hills. Aside from Grizzlemaw, the Hills are teeming with wild life. Snow-covered tree cover the land. Totems mark different Furbolg land 
								territory, so one needs to tread carefully.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class = "info_panel">
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/howling_fjord.jpg" alt ="Howling Fjord"/>
						<h1>Howling Fjord</h1>
						<p>		Howling Fjord holds what was once the only port city in Northrend, Valgarde. The area receives its name for the wind that howls as it races from the sea inland.
								The climate remains much milder than the rest of Northrend, making it perfect for farming. The land itself is distinguished by its high cliffs dropping into the 
								sea below.  </p>
						</p> 	Humans are the primary population in the area, though this is being threatened by the newly awakened Vrykul.</p>
