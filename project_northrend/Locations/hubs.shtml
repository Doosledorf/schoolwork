						<h1>Dalaran</h1>
						<p>		A city of mages acts as a base of offense against the Lich King...that is what Dalaran is about. Archmage Rhonin rules as head of the Council of Six and Dalaran 
								itself.</p>
						<p>		Dalaran is a neutral city. It has both Alliance and Horde "sides." A player from one faction is barred from touching down on an opposing faction's "side." The
								majority of the city is neutral ground still. Marked by its huge towers and the fact that it is, uh, floating, Dalaran stands as a haven for those who come to study the
								arcane. Mages of the Kirin Tor are so dedicated to the cities survival that even when destroyed by Arthas years prior, they saw to its rebuilding
								and eventual rise to the skies </p>
						<p>		Dalaran was not originally airborne, nor above Northrend, but in the wake of Malygos' war on wizards, the city moved to the skies of Northrend as an act of defiance.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/valiance_keep.jpg" alt ="Valiance Keep"/>
					
					
						<h1>Valiance Keep</h1>
						<p>		Valiance Keep serves as the base of entry for the Valliance Expedition, the Alliance's main force in Northrend. It also serves at the only other port for the 
								Alliance besides Valgarde. General Arios wathces over the keep while Bolvar Fordragon assaults Icecrown Citadel. The Keep itself lies on the tip of the Borean Tundra</p>
						<p> 	There are two major landmarks at the Keep: the lording castle and the "icebreaker" ship in the center. The ship divides the area in two, but serves as 
								a bridge of sorts when not in use. </p>
						<p>		This serves as the starting point in Northrend for all Alliance players. It can be reached in Stormwind by boarding "The Kraken", another icebreaker.</p>

					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/warsong_hold.jpg" alt ="Warsong Hold"/>
					
					
						<h1>Warsong Hold</h1>
						<p>		Opposite to Valiance Keep stands Warsong Hold, a base of entry for the Warsong Offensive, the Horde's main force in Northrend. Horde players start their
								Northrend adventure here via a zeppelin from Orgrimmar. Varok Saurfang and Garrosh Hellscream, the leader of the Horde itself, hold command of the hold(hehe)
								as they make plans to storm Icecrown Citadel...all the while battling the Alliance, whose Valiance Keep is not very far away.</p>
						<p>		The Hold itself is very similar in construction to the Horde capital, Orgrimmar. Big steel structures, lots of towers and heavy use of stone. It provides for
								a very imposing base of operations for the Horde.</p>

				<div class = "info_panel">
					
					<img class = "infoImage" src = "../Assets/Locations/wintergrasp_fortress.jpg" alt ="Wintergrasp Fortress"/>
					
					
						<h1>Wintergrasp Fortress</h1>
						<p>		The main PVP zone for Alliance and Horde members a like, Wintergrasp Fortress acts as a center of zone-control, and perhaps opportunity for players.</p>
						<p> 	The fortress is the only major landmark in Wintergrasp. One cannot miss it. Plenty of walls, battlements and towers to see here. Being a constant PVP zone means
								that one cannot simply walk around for the sights. This is a place of constant battle.</p>
						<p>		The controlling faction gets access to their faction's Wintergrasp vendors, where points gained through PVP can be spent on PVP/PVE rewards. The Vault of Archavon's 
								entrance lies in the fortress itself and it too, houses many PVP rewards...if you can defeat its guardians.</p>
